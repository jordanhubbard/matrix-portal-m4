# Conway's game of life - Originally written by Robert Gallup

Updated for Circuit Python 9.x - necessary libraries are also checked
in to Python/lib though you may already have them installed - they are
provided purely for reference purposes.  Updated for 2 64x64 panels.

Ultimately, you don't really want to do this in Python though.  It's too
slow.  See Arduino example for a much faster versio.
